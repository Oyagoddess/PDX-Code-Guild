    <h1><center><font color= "FF4444">Greetings World</font></center></h1>
    <p>Welcome to my very first website!</p>
    <p>My name is Shalonda. I am currently attending Junior Developer training at <a href="http://pdxcodeguild.com/" target="_blank">PDX Code Guild.</a></p>
    <p>Through this process I am reminded that in learning something new you will have to be very patient with yourself and the process.</p>
    <p>Some things may be very easy to learn and understand, and others may take more time to learn. You see, if you don't have experince in code developing
 and programming it may be very challenging and intimidating.</p>

    <p> Coding is like learning a whole new language. You have to erase your own knowledge of what makes sense to you and pay close attention to the content,
 context and codes. You must learn the terminology and how the functions work. You also need to do your best to follow the step by step process taking 
 small pieces of creating a program before you start thinking about shortcuts and creating the best program ever. Forget about what you think would make since,and just follow the instructions.
    <strong><i>Believe me it will save you a lot of grief and time.</i></strong></p>
    <p>There may be times that you will be sitting in class feeling like a dear in headlights because everything sounds so foriegn.</p>

    <p><i> I have to admit, I struggled with learning Python. 
Python was taught during the first four weeks of class.  You will learn about: list,strings,tupals, dictionaries, loops, variables, instances, classes,
attributes, methods to name a few, but that alone  is a handful to learn. If you are unfamiliar with any of these terms i would suggest taking some 
tutorials, buying a book to reference.</i></p>
    <p><strong><font color="990000">In order to be successful in python and in class, I have a few words of advice:</font></strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><p> <font color= "008000">Ask questions when you are stuck or are in programmers hell, don't wait to long becuase a second set of eyes may be able to find the 
problem much quicker.</font></p></li>
        <li><p>Make sure you save your work and push it to Github, which will be a backup if you break your code.</p></li>
    <p>Here are a few functions to remember to push to github from terminal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li> git status</li>
            <li>git add -m </li>
            <li>git push</li></ul>
        <li><p>Do not create multiple projects of updated versions of your code, push to Github, becuase if you break your code, it will 
be confusing to know what worked.</p></li>
        <li><p>Start your projects one code base at a time, and build from working code. Don't try to build the whole code upfront.</p></li>
        <li><p>Test as you build each code in the program.</p></li>
        <li><p>Study, research online, ask questions, and use your instuctor and staff for extra help.</p></li>
    </ol>
